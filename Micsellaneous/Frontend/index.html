    <!-- GET REQ -->
    <!-- Used to request data from a server.
    Data is sent in the URL query string (e.g. example.com/search?q=hello).
    Typically used for reading/fetching information (safe, no side effects). -->

    <!-- Parameters visible in URL.
    Can be bookmarked/cached.
    Limited data size (depends on browser/server, usually ~2KB).
    Faster than POST for small data fetch. -->
    <h1>Get request form</h1>
    <form action="http://localhost:8080/register" method="get">
        <label for="username">Username:</label>
        <input type="text" id="username" name="username">
        <br>
        <label for="password">Password:</label>
        <input type="password" id="password" name="password">
        <br>
        <button>Submit</button>
    </form>
    <p>When this get req form is submitted the req will be sent to register route but the query will be visible in the url.</p>


    <!-- POST REQ -->
    <!-- Used to send data to the server to create/update a resource.
    Data is sent in the request body, not in the URL.
    Commonly used in forms, authentication, file upload. -->

    <!-- Data is hidden (not shown in URL).
    No size limit for data (good for large files).
    Not cached/bookmarked by default.
    More secure than GET (but still requires HTTPS). -->
    <h1>Post request form</h1>
    <form action="http://localhost:8080/register" method="post">
        <label for="username">Username:</label>
        <input type="text" id="username" name="username">
        <br>
        <label for="password">Password:</label>
        <input type="password" id="password" name="password">
        <br>
        <button>Submit</button>
    </form>
    <p>When this post req form is submitted the req will be sent to register route but the query will NOT be visible in the url.</p>



    <!-- ❌ Drawbacks of GET over POST

    1. Security Risk → Sensitive data (like passwords) is exposed in URL and can be stored in browser history, server logs, etc.

    2. Data Length Limit → URL length restrictions limit how much data can be sent.

    3. Not Suitable for Confidential Operations → Should not be used for login forms, payment processing, etc.

    4. Caching Issues → Browsers/servers may cache GET requests, which can cause unexpected results.

    5. Less Flexible → Cannot handle complex or large structured data efficiently. -->
